# Welcome to DOPESTATION
Dopestation is a PowerShell script used for the viewing of Dopelives.com streams. It utilises [Streamlink](https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink) and [VLC](https://www.videolan.org).
It aims to supplant the successful [DopeStreamer](https://github.com/tvkanters/Dopestreamer) project, which presented a great user interface but lacked features and required the installation of the [Java](https://www.java.com) framework.

Dopelives.com is a community focused around streaming and discussion of video games. While the website serves as a perfectly serviceable hub to the content, "power users" often prefer to connect to the service using a dedicated IRC client and a tool to pipe streams directly through to a media player.  
Dopestation provides a simple interface for downloading, setting up and using such viewing tools, and can be left idle to wait for streams and tune into them when they are available.
